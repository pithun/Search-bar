# Search-bar

## Deascription
A python script which i used to search for keywords in different files in a directory.

## Technologies/Tools Used
- Python
- Os
- Regular Expressions(Regex)

## Use case
While learning python and data analysis libraries i wrote codes in .py files and also some notes in .txt files. I wrote soo many and sometimes I found it hard to find the exact file I wrote something I needed to reference. So I wrote this code to basically open all those files and help me find where a particular keyword I search is.
